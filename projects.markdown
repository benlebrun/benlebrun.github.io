## Ongoing

* ### Musical Power-Laws
Many musical phenomena are said to follow a power-law, including the melodic intervals of Bach, Chopin, Debussy, Mendelssohn, Mozart, and Schoenberg, the harmonies and rhythms of classical music, and in melodies composed by Mozart, Chopin, Irving Berlin, and Jerome Kern. More recently, power-law behaviour has been observed in the global distributions of relative rhythmic and melodic bigram ranks. However, the statistical methods that were used to test this hypothesis have been shown to produce biased and sometimes incorrect results. As such, this project aims to re-test the power-law hypothesis using the method outlined by Clauset et al. (2009).

* ### The Mavening
A recent wave of high-profile transformations at a variety of publications have indicated that the goal of corporate ownership is to dramatically reduce staff (by half in many cases) and cut costs. Critics of this process have suggested that such financial decision-making has had a significant impact on the quality of journalistic content. Using the tools of computational textual analysis, we aim to test this claim by examining stylistic and topical content before and after the identified moments of transformation. We have collected and are currently examining hundreds of thousands of articles with the goal of generalizing about the effects such transformations have on journalistic content.

* ### Cultural Inequality in Spotify Playlist Curation 
This project seeks to understanding the effects of Spotifyâ€™s curatorial processes on the visibility of different kinds of artists and the extent to which the playlist curation process potentially amplifies or mitigates existing levels of inequality within the music industry. Overall, we have collected and are analyzing over 128,000 Spotify playlist entries as well as 6 years of Billboard chart data. While the final version of this project is not yet completed, a white paper examining curatorial patterns across the Spotify data set is available [here](https://txtlab.org/2020/05/are-you-genre-fluid-a-new-collaboration-on-spotify-by-cheng-lin-and-benjamin-lebrun/).

## Past

- ### McHacks7: Tell Me More
We built an app that uses machine learning to read and calculate the sentiment of hand written journal entries. The project was awarded "Best use of Watson NLU API" by IBM. You can find more information on the [devpost](https://devpost.com/software/tell-me-more).

* ### MAIS 202 Final Project: Evaluating Syntactic Heuristics in BERT NLI
In the context of an extra-curicular machine learning course, I trained BERT on the MNLI data set and tested it on HANS, a heuristic analysis data set. I highly recommend that you check out [the paper introducing HANS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01007).
