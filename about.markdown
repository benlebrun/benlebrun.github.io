I'm a third year undergraduate student double majoring in computer science and linguistics  at McGill University. I am also a research assistant at [txtLab](https://txtlab.org/), a laboratory for cultural analytics, and an undergraduate student researcher at [MCQLL](http://mcqll.org/), the Montreal Computational and Qualitative Linguistics Lab. Broadly, my interests are in computational linguistics, probabilistic modelling, and digital humanities. Feel free to check out what I've been up to [here](../projects/).
