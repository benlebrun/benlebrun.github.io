I'm a third year undergraduate student double majoring in computer science and linguistics  at McGill University. I am also a research assistant at [txtLab](https://txtlab.org/), a laboratory for cultural analytics, and an undergraduate student researcher at [MCQLL](http://mcqll.org/), the Montreal Computational and Qualitative Linguistics Lab. My research interest involves understanding how large language models learn the complexity of natural language. I am also interested in the digital humanities. Feel free to check out what I've been up to [here](../projects/).
